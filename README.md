	Admins assign tasks to employees and view whether employees have completed these tasks. At the same time, employees can view the tasks admins assign and mark their progress.

2. Messaging
  Users can enter the message section by clicking on the message icon on the top right of the menu. Then, on the left, they can split the messages of the working list to send them and send them messages from the opened message.
  Thus, they can instantly message each other.

4. Leave Requests
  This feature is to make the leave requests system easier for both employees and admins. In order to open the leave requests part, both employees and admins should select leave days section from the menu bar on the left.
  Admins can see the leave request that has been sent in a table. If they want to view the details of it and adjust its permission, they can do it by clicking the request in the table and they can reject or approve it.
  Employees can send their requests by setting the start and end dates, title, and description. In order to send, their remaining vacation days should be higher than the subtraction of start date and end date.
